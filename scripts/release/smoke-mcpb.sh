# smoke-mcpb.sh — stage the .mcpb and START it, exactly as a host would.
#
# The regression this pins: for the whole life of the .mcpb channel, the bundle
# was assembled at release time and never launched. manifest.json declares
#     server.mcp_config = { command: "node", args: ["${__dirname}/mcp-server/index.js"] }
# and running that against the staged tree failed with `Cannot find module
# 'ajv'`, because the tree carried no node_modules and nothing invoked
# bin/ensure-deps.sh. A green test suite said nothing about it: the suite
# exercises the workspace sources, never the distributable.
#
# So this speaks MCP over stdio to the staged artifact and asserts the two
# things a host does first. Anything less — "the file exists", "the bundle is
# 2.7 MB" — would have passed while the server was unstartable.
#
# The version assertion below pins a second regression of the same shape: this
# script printed `serverInfo.version` in its OK line and asserted only that a
# serverInfo existed, so the server advertised a hardcoded 0.4.0 for three
# releases while the manifest shipped 0.6.1, in CI, in green. A number nobody
# compares is a number nobody maintains.
#
# Exit 0 iff: initialize returns a serverInfo whose version is the one
# manifest.json declares, AND tools/list returns the expected tool count.
# Exit 1 with the transcript otherwise.
