 * specOracle — Hard Output Rules validation via @prd-gen/validation.

 *                is a valid SectionType; payload.expected_passes is the claim.
 * Postcondition: truth = ((violations.length === 0) === expected_passes).
 *                oracle_evidence is non-empty, human-readable, and contains
 *                the caveat about internal grounding.
 * Invariant:     No LLM calls are made. validateSection() is pure regex/parsing.
 *
 * !! IMPORTANT — INTERNAL GROUNDING CAVEAT !!
 * This oracle is "weakly external" because @prd-gen/validation is maintained
 * by the same team as the annotators it grounds. Rule changes to the validator
 * silently shift ground truth. See docs/PHASE_4_PLAN.md §4.1 for the full
 * discussion. The evidence string ALWAYS includes this caveat so downstream
 * consumers can weight it appropriately.
 *
 * Layer: benchmark/calibration. Depends on @prd-gen/validation (inner
 *   workspace package — acceptable; benchmark is in the same monorepo and
 *   depends on validation per package.json).
