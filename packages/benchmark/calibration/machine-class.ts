/**
 * Machine-class detection + per-bucket gate lookup for Phase 4.5.
 *
 * Phase 4.5 calibrates `wall_time_ms` against the canned-baseline pipeline
 * (`makeCannedDispatcher`) at the frozen merge-base of Wave B. Because
 * canned-pipeline wall-time is dominated by JS execution speed (no LLM,
 * no I/O), it is sensitive to host-machine class. A single global gate is
 * either too tight on a slow CI runner or too loose on a fast workstation.
 *
 * This module:
 *   1. Buckets the host into one of MACHINE_CLASSES from `os.cpus()` +
 *      `os.totalmem()`. Heuristic, deterministic, no shelling out.
 *   2. Looks up the per-bucket calibrated `wall_time_ms` gate value, falling
 *      back to a single provisional value when no per-bucket calibration
 *      data exists.
 *
 * Layer contract (§2.2): imports from Node stdlib only. No
 * @prd-gen/core / @prd-gen/orchestration imports — this is a leaf utility
 * consumed by `pipeline-kpis.ts` (which is already in the calibration
 * import perimeter via `instrumentation.ts`).
 *
 * source: docs/PHASE_4_PLAN.md §4.5 — per-machine-class wall_time_ms gate.
 * source: C3 deliverable, Phase 4 Wave C.
