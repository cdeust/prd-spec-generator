/**
 * Pipeline runner — stateless reducer with emit_message coalescing.
 *
 * Inputs:  current PipelineState + optional last ActionResult fed from host.
 * Output:  updated PipelineState + the next SUBSTANTIVE NextAction the host
 *          must execute, plus the list of messages that were emitted while
 *          advancing to it.
 *
 * Coalescing: handlers may emit an `emit_message` action when they
 * advance state without needing host involvement (banners, status updates).
 * The host never has to "advance past" an emit_message — the runner re-enters
 * automatically until it produces an action that genuinely requires the host
 * (ask_user, call_*_tool, spawn_subagents, write_file, done, failed) or until
 * a maximum re-entry cap is reached (defense-in-depth against handler bugs).
 *
 * The runner NEVER performs I/O. It cannot itself call MCP tools, spawn
 * agents, or interact with the user. All side effects are delegated to the
 * host via the substantive NextAction. The host calls `step()` again with
 * the result, advancing the FSM.
 *
 * This separation is what makes the orchestrator testable: every handler is
 * a pure function that takes (state, result?) and returns (state', action).
