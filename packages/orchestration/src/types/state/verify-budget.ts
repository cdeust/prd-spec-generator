 * Judge-panel budget for self-check's multi-judge verification batch
 * (handlers/self-check.ts / handlers/self-check-verify-budget.ts).
 *
 * The composition root (mcp-server) MAY inject an override on
 * `PipelineState.verify_budget` before a run starts — mirrors `retry_policy`
 * in core-state.ts. The reducer only ever READS this field; it never derives
 * or mutates it (§1.5 DIP / §5.2 composition-root pattern). `null` means
 * "use DEFAULT_VERIFY_BUDGET" (handlers/self-check-verify-budget.ts).
 *
 * Rationale for the shape: judging PRD claims is read-and-compare work, not
 * frontier reasoning — it does not need the session's own model. A run with
 * ~29 claims under the PRIOR uncapped panel (2-3 genius + 1-2 team judges per
 * claim, all dispatched with no `model`/`effort` field, so the host ran every
 * one under the session model) produced 89 judge invocations in one batch.
 * source: measured e2e run run_mrlqa0aj_u2rh15 (2026-07-15), batch_id
 * self_check_verify, 89 invocations, 3 judges x 28 FR/AC claims + a 5-judge
 * architecture panel x 1 architecture claim.

   * HONEST LIMIT (arXiv:2602.11865, DeepMind "Virtual Agent Economies" —

   * model independence. Every entry in the default list ("haiku", "sonnet")
   * is a Claude-family model sharing one vendor's pretraining corpus and
   * alignment lineage — cycling between them mitigates only INTRA-family
   * blind spots (the two models can still share a systematic misreading of
   * the same claim). It does not, and cannot, close the monoculture gap
   * that a genuinely independent (cross-vendor) verifier would. This field
   * accepts arbitrary model-identifier strings specifically so a host with
   * cross-vendor judge routing (e.g. a non-Claude model reachable through
   * its own subagent_type) can close that gap WITHOUT a schema change —
   * the type is `string`, not a Claude-model enum. Standard (non-
   * architecture) subjective claims still dispatch a single judge under
   * `judge_model` — diversity slots are reserved for the highest-stakes
   * panel by design, not applied uniformly, to keep the invocation-count
   * reduction this feature exists for (see module doc above).
