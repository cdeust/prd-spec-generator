/**
 * Bounded-I/O caps for in-memory pipeline arrays (Phase 1c).
 *
 * PipelineState lives in the runStore and is serialized into MCP responses
 * (get_pipeline_state format:"full" returns the whole state; section prompts
 * embed clarification_qa). Two append-only arrays can grow without bound:
 * `clarifications` (one turn per Q&A round) and `errors` (one per failure).
 * Neither had a contract cap before Phase 1c — the per-context clarification
 * range bounds rounds in the handler, but for the default tier
 * CAPABILITIES.maxClarificationRounds is Infinity, so the schema is the only
 * guaranteed bound.
 *
 * Budget derivation (measured, not invented):
 *   Claude Code rejects MCP tool results over 25,000 tokens = 100,000 chars
 *   of compact JSON.
 *   source: Claude Code 2.1.170 binary, extracted 2026-06-10 — default
 *   MAX_MCP_OUTPUT_TOKENS d4O=25000, estimator chars/4 → 100,000 char cap.
 *   Verified char-exact against a rejected 324,429-char response. Mirrors the
 *   Cortex sibling repo's MAX_RESPONSE_CHARS = 100_000.

 * Cap = floor((MAX_RESPONSE_CHARS / 2) / 1000) = 50. Half the budget is
 * reserved for clarifications so the other half covers the rest of the state
 * (sections, errors, grounding) when format:"full" is requested.

 * Max error messages retained (FIFO). Genuine error messages only — not a

 * parallel error_kinds entry is a single enum token. The errors array ships
 * its length over MCP (envelope.state_summary.errors) but its contents ship in
 * format:"full". Cap so the array cannot dominate the 100,000-char response
 * budget: floor((MAX_RESPONSE_CHARS / 4) / 500) = 50. A quarter of the budget
 * is allotted to errors+kinds; the rest covers sections, clarifications, and
 * grounding.
 *   source: 500-char error floor is the project convention (errors are
 *   single-sentence failure messages, not stack dumps); measured 2026-06-10,
 *   longest observed pipeline error was 312 chars.
 * Eviction is FIFO with a dropped count surfaced via appendError's return —
 * never silent loss (Phase 1c rule). The oldest errors are dropped because the
 * most recent failures are the ones a caller acts on.
