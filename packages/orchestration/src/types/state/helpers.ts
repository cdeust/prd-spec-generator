 * Bounded-I/O (Phase 1c): the errors/error_kinds arrays are capped at
 * MAX_PIPELINE_ERRORS to stay within the Claude Code 100,000-char MCP response
 * budget (get_pipeline_state format:"full" ships the whole state). When the
 * cap is reached this performs FIFO eviction — the OLDEST entry is dropped so
 * the most recent failures (the ones a caller acts on) survive. Eviction is
 * NOT silent: the dropped count is recorded by incrementing the returned
 * state's `errors_dropped` so observability is preserved (Phase 1c rule).
 *
 * Precondition: state.errors.length === state.error_kinds.length (lockstep
 *   invariant, enforced by the PipelineStateSchema refine).
 * Postcondition: result.errors.length === result.error_kinds.length AND
 *   result.errors.length <= MAX_PIPELINE_ERRORS AND result.errors ends with
 *   `message` (the new error is never the one evicted) AND
 *   result.errors_dropped === state.errors_dropped + (1 if eviction occurred).
