/**
 * Snapshot of the verification plan dispatched in self-check Phase A.
 * Persisted so Phase B can map invocation_id → claim/judge without re-running
 * planDocumentVerification (which would corrupt attribution if state.sections
 * mutated between phases).
 *
 * `judges[i]` is the AgentIdentity that received `claim_ids[i]`. Storing both
 * preserves judge attribution in `ConsensusVerdict.judges` even on the
 * plan-mismatch fallback path — Bayesian reliability lookups remain correct.
 *
 * INVARIANT (load-bearing): `claim_ids.length === judges.length`. The
 * fallback path in self-check.ts:parseVerdictsFromSnapshot uses positional
 * lookups (`snapshot.judges[idx]` with `idx < snapshot.claim_ids.length`).
 * If lengths diverge, an out-of-bounds read returns `undefined`, which
 * later fails `agentKey()` in consensus.ts. Enforced via Zod refinement.
