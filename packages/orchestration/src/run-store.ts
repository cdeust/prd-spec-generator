 * SQLite-backed store — the contract is just `get` / `set` / `delete`.
 *
 * Bounded-I/O (Phase 3): without eviction the map grows once per
 * start_pipeline for the life of the process — a long-lived MCP host that
 * starts many runs leaks every terminal run's PipelineState forever. This
 * store now evicts TERMINAL runs (current_step === "complete") by TTL and by
 * a max-runs cap (LRU on last access). In-flight runs are NEVER evicted —
 * dropping an active run would strand the host mid-loop. Eviction is
 * observable (evicted counter + onEvict callback) — never silent loss,
 * mirroring appendError's errors_dropped (Phase 1c rule).
