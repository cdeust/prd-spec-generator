/**
 * `pr_gate` — the trust-seam human gate (design-phases-3-5.md §3, PR 5).
 *
 * This is the FIRST branch push / PR the pipeline ever opens. It is
 * MANDATORY and non-skippable: it always fires when reached, regardless of
 * the `review` verdict — including an advisory FAIL after `REVIEW_RETRY_CAP`
 * is exhausted (review.ts). A PR is opened here; it is NEVER self-merged —
 * see pr-creation.ts's `<prohibited>` block for the enforcement side of that
 * rule.
 *
 * The gate's message is an HONEST summary of what is about to be pushed:
 * the review verdict (PASS or an advisory FAIL, with findings), whether the
 * post-implementation security/regression gates passed, how many files
 * changed, and the branch name. A human deciding "push + open PR" must see
 * a FAIL verdict as plainly as a PASS one — hiding it would defeat the
 * point of a trust seam.
 *
 * Routing:
 *   - "Push + open PR" → `pr_creation`.
 *   - "No" → a VALID TERMINAL path (not a failure): straight to `finalize`
 *     with `post_specs.pr = {pushed:false, url:null}`.
 *
 * Non-bypass (design §6 lesson, restated here): UNLIKE every other step in
 * this loop, `pr_gate` has NO "already decided" idempotency shortcut. Every
 * other step's guard is `if (<result already recorded>) skip to next step`
 * (implementation.ts, testing.ts, review.ts) — that pattern is exactly what
 * this gate must NOT do, because the whole point of a mandatory gate is
 * that it cannot be bypassed by a state field happening to already be set.
 * A call to this handler with no matching `user_answer` ALWAYS emits
 * `ask_user` — there is no state under which it silently proceeds.
 *
 * source: design-phases-3-5.md §3, §4, §6 PR 5.
