/**
 * Self-check (SKILL.md Rule 13).
 *
 * Two-phase:
 *   Phase A — emit a multi-judge verification batch over all generated sections.
 *             The host spawns the judges in parallel via the Agent tool and
 *             feeds the verdicts back as a `subagent_batch_result`.
 *   Phase B — combine deterministic `validateDocument` violations + multi-judge
 *             VerificationReport into the final `done` summary.
 *
 * If verification yields zero claims (e.g. nothing extractable from a tiny
 * PRD), Phase B runs immediately on Phase A's "no judges to run" path.
 *
 * self_check no longer emits `remember`/`done` itself (PR 3b,
 * design-phases-3-5.md §2.2): finalize() computes the final
 * summary/artifacts/verification, stores it in `state.pending_completion`,
 * and advances to `implementation_gate` — the post-specs human gate. The
 * relocated Phase C (Cortex `remember` → `done`) now lives in
 * handlers/finalize.ts, the sole step that reaches `complete`.
