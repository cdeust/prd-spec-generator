/**
 * Input analysis — call automatised-pipeline `analyze_codebase`, then
 * `prepare_prd_input` (FEATURE MODE) to ground the feature on the code graph.
 *
 * Tool contracts (source of truth: automatised-pipeline/src/tool_schemas.rs,
 * verified against automatised-pipeline/src/main.rs do_analyze_codebase,
 * 2026-07-13):
 *   analyze_codebase (Stage 3 — all-in-one: index_codebase + resolve_graph +
 *   cluster_graph in one call; tool_schemas.rs:522 analyze_codebase_schema):
 *     inputs:  { path, output_dir, language?, dependency_scope? }
 *     output:  { graph_path, index, resolve, cluster:{community_count,
 *                process_count, modularity} }   ← graph tools take graph_path
 *   prepare_prd_input (feature mode — no finding_id):
 *     inputs:  { feature_description, output_dir, graph_path }
 *     output:  prd_context { matched_symbols, impacted_communities,
 *                            impacted_processes, graph_stats, mode:"feature" }
 *
 * We deliberately call `analyze_codebase` rather than bare `index_codebase`:
 * `index_codebase` alone is Stage 3a ONLY (parse + build graph nodes/edges) —
 * it does NOT resolve call/import edges (Stage 3b) or detect communities/
 * processes (Stage 3c). Grounding via `prepare_prd_input` on an
 * index-only graph therefore returns impacted_community_count=0 and
 * impacted_process_count=0 regardless of the real codebase (measured
 * 2026-07-13, e2e run_mrjlmfh6_3tq3d4, cobaye repo graphify: 0/0 via
 * index_codebase vs 9 communities / 162 processes via analyze_codebase on
 * the same repo — see Cortex memory 4263670). `analyze_codebase` performs
 * index+resolve+cluster in one host round trip, which is also fewer
 * `call_pipeline_tool` hops than doing the three stages piecemeal.
 *
 * Two sequential host-driven calls, each following the established reducer
 * protocol (emit call_pipeline_tool → host runs it → result fed back via
 * tool_result → handler processes result.data):
 *   1. analyze_codebase        → sets codebase_graph_path / codebase_indexed
 *   2. prepare_prd_input        → sets codebase_grounding / prd_input_prepared
 * Only after BOTH complete does the step advance to feasibility_gate.
 *
 * The output_dir is derived from run_id so retries are idempotent and runs
 * do not collide. We write under <codebase_path>/.prd-gen/graphs/<run_id>/
 * by default; a real deployment may want to override via env var.
 *
 * Git hygiene (defect found in the same e2e run, memory 4263670): a run
 * writes ~39MB of graph artifacts under <codebase_path>/.prd-gen/. That path
 * lives INSIDE the user's target repo and is not git-ignored by default —
 * left unaddressed it would pollute the user's `git status`/commits. This
 * handler is a pure reducer (StepHandler: state → {state, action}, no direct
 * fs access — see the module's layer contract in runner.ts) so it cannot
 * write the guard file itself; it emits a `write_file` action for
 * `.prd-gen/.gitignore` (content: `*`, the standard self-ignore pattern used
 * by `.next/`/`.turbo/`) THE SAME WAY file-export.ts writes PRD output files
 * — through the existing write_file/file_written port, executed by the host
 * (or canned-dispatcher.ts in tests). Idempotency is tracked in its own
 * `state.codebase_gitignore_written` flag rather than `state.written_files`:
 * that array is the PRD-deliverable ledger (pipeline-kpis.ts counts it as
 * `written_files_count`, expected to land on exactly the 9 PRD output
 * files) — folding an infrastructure guard file into it would silently
 * inflate that KPI. This write is emitted once, before the first
 * `analyze_codebase` call that would otherwise be the first thing to
 * populate `.prd-gen/`.
