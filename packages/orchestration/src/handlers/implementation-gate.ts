/**
 * `implementation_gate` — the human gate between the PRD deliverables
 * (self_check) and the post-specs implementation loop.
 *
 * self_check's finalize() has already computed `state.pending_completion`
 * and advanced here (design-phases-3-5.md §2.2). This handler:
 *   1. Evaluates the verification-acceptance policy (handlers/
 *      verification-policy.ts `evaluatePolicy`) over
 *      `pending_completion.verification`.
 *   2. Asks a question shaped by that verdict — "Implement" vs "PRD only"
 *      when the policy passed cleanly; an explicit-derogation question
 *      naming the blocking claims/disagreements/unsampled ratio otherwise
 *      (see `buildPolicyGateQuestion`). Routes:
 *        - "prd_only" → `finalize` directly. Zero regression for the
 *          policy-"pass" case (design §5, PR 3b acceptance criterion).
 *        - "implement" → `pre_impl_grounding`.
 *   3. Records a `policy_derogation` on `state.post_specs` whenever
 *      "implement" was chosen against a non-"pass" policy verdict.
 *
 * precondition:  state.pending_completion !== null (set by self_check's
 *                finalize() before advancing here).
 *
 * VERIFICATION-REPORT EXPORT (root-cause note, 2026-07-15, extended
 * 2026-07-15 for the policy gap — e2e run run_mrlqa0aj_u2rh15: the jury
 * returned 1 FAIL + 20 INCONCLUSIVE, yet this gate asked its question
 * exactly as if every claim had passed): self-check's verification results
 * were computed but never written to a file — only carried in the transient
 * `pending_completion`/`done` payload. `implementation_gate` is the FIRST
 * step reached once `pending_completion` is set (see precondition above),
 * so it writes `10-verification-report.md` (`buildVerificationReportFile`,
 * verification-report.ts) via the SAME write_file protocol file_export
 * uses. WRITE TIMING depends on the policy verdict:
 *   - status "pass": written BEFORE the question is asked (today's exact
 *     behavior, zero regression) — the decision cannot yet change the
 *     report's content since no derogation is possible on this path.
 *   - status "needs_attention" / "blocked": the question IS asked first
 *     (its header/description already names every blocking claim —
 *     `buildPolicyGateQuestion` — so a human is never blind); the report is
 *     written ONCE, after the answer, so it can render the recorded
 *     decision/derogation rather than a "pending" placeholder. This is
 *     still exactly one file_write round trip for this path, matching the
 *     "pass" path's cost.
 *
 * source: design-phases-3-5.md §2.2, §3 "implementation_gate", §7
