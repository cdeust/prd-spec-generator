/**
 * Preflight — verify required MCP servers are reachable BEFORE the pipeline
 * begins to depend on them.
 *
 * The pipeline relies on two ecosystem MCPs at runtime:
 *   - cortex            (call_cortex_tool: per-section memory recall)
 *   - ai-architect      (call_pipeline_tool: index_codebase, when a
 *                        codebase path is supplied)
 *
 * Without preflight, a missing Cortex meant the host returned
 * `success: false` for every section's recall step — silent per-section
 * degradation that surfaced only as an unexplained drop in section
 * quality. With preflight, the same condition surfaces ONCE at startup as
 * a single `failed` action with actionable setup instructions.
 *
 * The check uses the lightest available probe per MCP — Cortex's
 * `memory_stats` (a read-only diagnostic that returns immediately on a
 * healthy server) and ai-architect's `health_check`. When the host
 * returns `success: false`, we treat that as "MCP not registered or
 * unreachable" and emit a `failed` action.
 *
 * Callers that intentionally run without Cortex can pass
 * `skip_preflight: true` to `newPipelineState` (or `start_pipeline`),
 * which marks `preflight_status = "skipped"` at construction and lets
 * this handler short-circuit on the first call.
 *
 * source: missing-Cortex bug found 2026-04-26 during the wiki-grooming
 * PRD run on the Cortex repo. Cortex was disabled in user settings; the
 * pipeline silently dropped recall context for every section, and
 * Technical Specification quality cratered without anyone noticing the
 * load-bearing dependency had vanished.
