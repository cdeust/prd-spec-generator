/**
 * `finalize` — Cortex `remember`, run once per pipeline, immediately before
 * the terminal `done` action. The ONLY step that reaches `current_step:
 * "complete"` (design-phases-3-5.md §2.2).
 *
 * Relocated from self-check/remember-phase.ts (Phase 1b, 2026-07-14) as part
 * of PR 3b — the post-specs implementation gate now sits between
 * self_check's PRD deliverables and this terminal remember/done pair.
 * self_check's finalize() no longer emits `remember` itself: it computes the
 * final summary/artifacts/verification, stores it in
 * `state.pending_completion`, and advances to `implementation_gate`. Every
 * path through the (PR-3b-scoped) post-specs loop — "prd_only" straight from
 * the gate, or "implement" → pre_impl_grounding's dead-end — converges here.
 *
 * Phase C logic itself is UNCHANGED from remember-phase.ts: the reducer
 * needs a host round trip to run `remember`, and the verdicts that produced
 * the summary are not recoverable on a later step() call (verification_plan
 * is cleared during self-check Phase B; the batch_result is not persisted).
 * Storing the already-computed payload is the seam: this module either
 * (a) emits the remember call, or (b) once its result comes back (or
 * `run_remembered` is already true on replay), reconstructs the exact `done`
 * action from `pending_completion`.
 *
 * A `remember` failure is best-effort and MUST NOT block completion — the
 * run has already produced its deliverables; recording that fact durably in
 * Cortex is a bonus, not a precondition, mirroring the per-section recall's
 * degrade-gracefully contract in section-generation.ts.
 *
 * source: Phase 1b (2026-07-14) — Cortex memory-loop closure (original Phase
 * C). source: design-phases-3-5.md §2.2, §5 PR 3b — relocation.
