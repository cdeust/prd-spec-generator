/**
 * Judge-panel budget for self-check's Phase A/B multi-judge verification
 * batch. Extracted from self-check.ts (§4.1 500-line file cap) — this module
 * owns ONE concern: turning a full `JudgeRequest[]` plan (every judge in
 * PANELS, judge-selector.ts) into a bounded, deterministic invocation set,
 * and building the `ask_user` gate when that set still exceeds budget.
 *
 * self-check.ts owns phase sequencing and snapshot bookkeeping; this module
 * owns the pure reduction/sampling/gate-construction functions. Both are
 * "self-check's own files" — no other handler imports from here.
 *
 * source: measured e2e run run_mrlqa0aj_u2rh15 (2026-07-15) — the batch
 * `self_check_verify` dispatched 89 judge invocations (3 judges x 28 FR/AC
 * claims + a 5-judge architecture panel x 1 architecture claim), each a
 * ~37K-char prompt, with no `model`/`effort` field — the host ran every one
 * under the session model. Judging (read the claim, read the evidence,
 * compare) does not need frontier reasoning; a default of 1 judge/claim
 * under "haiku"/"low", gated at a 20-invocation cap, is the fix.
