/**
 * File export — write the PRD deliverable files (6 core + up to 3 companion,
 * one run-notes file when any section was skipped) per SKILL.md Phase 4,
 * plus an optional sidecar (`stage-5.affected_symbols.json`) when the
 * technical_specification section asserted symbol-level claims.
 *
 * Protocol:
 *   - On entry with no result: emit write_file for the first un-written file.
 *   - On file_written result: append to state.written_files, emit the next.
 *   - When state.written_files covers every file in the set → transition to self_check.
 *
 * Progress is tracked in `state.written_files` (a dedicated field). It is
 * NOT folded into `state.errors`; that field is reserved for genuine errors.
 *
 * NO PLACEHOLDER FILES (root-cause fix — see buildFileSet doc below):
 * a companion file whose source section(s) produced no content is NEVER
 * written; its skip and the reason are recorded in `00-run-notes.md`
 * instead. source: e2e run_mrlqa0aj_u2rh15 (2026-07-15) — 5 of 10 exported
 * files were one-line "_No ... section._" placeholders the user discovered
 * only after delivery.
 *
 * The affected-symbols sidecar is conditional (not always emitted):
 * automatised-pipeline stage 6 treats an ABSENT
 * `stage-5.affected_symbols.json` as "fall back to regex extraction" and a
 * PRESENT-BUT-EMPTY one as "the PRD asserts zero claims" — the latter would
 * wrongly suppress the regex fallback. So the sidecar is written only when
 * parseAffectedSymbolsBlock found ≥1 claim.
 * source: automatised-pipeline stages/stage-6.md §4.2.
