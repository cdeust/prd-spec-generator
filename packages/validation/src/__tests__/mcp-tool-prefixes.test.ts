/**
 * Repo-wide gate: every plugin-scoped MCP tool prefix named anywhere in this
 * repository must be one the host can actually resolve.
 *
 * Why this exists. The host derives a plugin-scoped MCP tool name as
 * `mcp__plugin_<plugin-name>_<server-key>__<tool>` — BOTH halves are in the
 * name. Cortex v4.15.0 renamed its plugin `cortex` -> `hypermnesia-mcp` while
 * keeping the server key `cortex`, and the rename commit asserted that "tool
 * names ... are untouched" because the server key had not moved. That premise
 * was false, and it silently broke `call_cortex_tool` in the skill: an
 * unresolvable MCP tool name is DROPPED by the host with no exception, no
 * warning, and no log line. Section-context recall returned nothing and PRD
 * generation carried on as if it had.
 *
 * A prefix that lives only in prose and comments cannot fail a type-check or a
 * unit test, so nothing in this repo could have caught it. This test is that
 * missing gate. It is deliberately a test rather than a new CI workflow so it
 * runs inside `build + test`, which already gates every PR.
