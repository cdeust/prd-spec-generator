/**
 * Response bounding for `get_pipeline_state` format:"full" (Phase 1d).
 *
 * THE BUG THIS FIXES
 * ------------------
 * Phase 1c capped the unbounded *input* arrays individually, each derived as a
 * SHARE of the 100,000-char Claude Code MCP response budget:
 *   - codebase_grounding bundle fields  ≈ 90k  (PrdInputBundleSchema)
 *   - clarifications (50 turns × ~1k)    ≈ 50k
 *   - errors+error_kinds (50 × ~500)     ≈ 25k
 * The shares were computed independently and OVERLAP. A single state sitting at
 * all three caps serializes to 90k + 50k + 25k + (sections, prd_validation,
 * scalars) ≈ 165k+ — well over the 100,000-char ceiling — so the Claude Code
 * host REJECTS the whole response. The per-field caps bound each array in
 * isolation but never the AGGREGATE serialized state.
 *
 * THE FIX
 * -------
 * Bound at the response boundary, not by shrinking the input contracts (the
 * inputs are legitimately that large; the contracts are correct). Measure the
 * serialized payload and, if it exceeds the budget, DEGRADE GRACEFULLY in
 * priority order — shed the least caller-relevant detail first, iteratively,
 * until it fits. Every shed is OBSERVABLE in the payload (omitted/elided flags
 * with original sizes) and the full detail stays reachable via a narrower
 * format selector — dynamic loading, never silent data loss.
 *
 *   This mirrors ai-prd-builder ContextDecomposer's allocation (commit
 *   462de01): shed lowest-priority slots first until the assembled context
 *   fits its token budget.
 *
 * MEASUREMENT IS EXACT — NO SAFETY FACTOR
 * ---------------------------------------
 * The host estimates a tool result's token count as round(chars / 4), where
 * `chars` is the JavaScript string length. In JS, `String.length` IS the count
 * of UTF-16 code units — exactly the unit the host counts. So
 * `JSON.stringify(payload).length` measured here equals the host's `chars`
 * input bit-for-bit; the budget comparison is exact and needs NO safety margin.
 *
 *   This DIFFERS from the Python sibling (ai-prd-builder ContextManager.swift /
 *   the Cortex repo), where `len()` counts Unicode code POINTS, not UTF-16
 *   units — a string with astral-plane characters has fewer code points than
 *   UTF-16 units, so that side applies a 0.75 factor to guard the divergence.
 *   Here the units coincide, so guarding would only waste budget.
 *   source: ai-prd-builder ContextManager.swift commit 462de01.
 *
 * PRIORITY ORDER (least-relevant shed first)
 * ------------------------------------------
 * Derived from what callers actually need from format:"full". The documented
 * purpose (skill/commands/generate-prd.md Step 7, SKILL.md §"On failed") is
 * DIAGNOSIS: "The errors[] field ... contains the full diagnostic trail."
 * The lightweight envelope (format:"summary") already exposes section
 * statuses, clarification_rounds, and error COUNTS; format:"full" is the
 * detail-escalation path on top of that. Ranked by caller value:
 *
 *   keep   1. scalar state + flags + counts   — tiny, the diagnostic skeleton.
 *   keep   2. errors[] / error_kinds[]         — THE documented purpose; already
 *                                                FIFO-capped at 50 (~25k worst).
 *   shed-3 3. sections[] content               — work product; large only when
 *                                                many sections carry full
 *                                                markdown. Re-derivable from the
 *                                                exported PRD files.
 *   shed-2 4. clarifications[] (oldest first)  — historical Q&A; the NEWEST turn
 *                                                is the most relevant, so elide
 *                                                from the front.
 *   shed-1 5. codebase_grounding, prd_validation — opaque automatised-pipeline
 *                                                passthrough blobs, the LARGEST
 *                                                (~90k+), LEAST needed for
 *                                                failure diagnosis, and
 *                                                independently re-fetchable from
 *                                                AP. Shed FIRST.
 *
 * The shed order is the REVERSE of caller value: grounding (5) before
 * clarifications (4) before section content (3). errors and scalars are never
 * shed — sacrificing the diagnostic trail to fit a diagnostic response would
 * defeat the tool's purpose.
