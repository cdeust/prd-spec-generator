/**
 * Response bounding for `submit_action_result` / `start_pipeline` envelopes
 * that carry a `spawn_subagents` action (Phase 1e).
 *
 * THE BUG THIS FIXES
 * -------------------
 * self_check's judge-verification batch can spawn dozens of judge subagents
 * in one `spawn_subagents` action, each carrying a multi-KB prompt (built by
 * `buildJudgePrompt` — full section content + claim + judge instructions). A
 * batch of 89 invocations at ~37K chars each measured a 3.5MB serialized
 * envelope — 35x the Claude Code 100,000-char MCP response budget
 * (MAX_RESPONSE_CHARS, `@prd-gen/orchestration` bounded-io.ts) that
 * `get_pipeline_state format:"full"` already respects via
 * `boundFullStateResponse`. `envelope()` in pipeline-tools.ts (the shared
 * response builder for `start_pipeline` and `submit_action_result`) had NO
 * equivalent bound — the host had to grep a spilled file to recover the
 * batch.
 * source: e2e run_mrlqa0aj_u2rh15 (2026-07-15) — measured 3.5MB response.
 *
 * THE FIX
 * -------
 * Mirror `bound-full-state.ts`'s degrade-observably pattern at the ENVELOPE
 * boundary. When the full envelope's pretty-printed serialization exceeds
 * MAX_RESPONSE_CHARS and the action is `spawn_subagents`, replace every
 * invocation's `prompt` with an `OmittedStub` — keeping `invocation_id`,
 * `subagent_type`, `description`, and `isolation` intact — and record the
 * shed via a top-level `__bounded` marker (present on EVERY envelope, empty
 * `applied` when no degradation occurred — same invariant
 * `boundFullStateResponse` establishes). The full, unbounded action
 * (including every prompt) is recoverable via
 * `get_pipeline_state(run_id, format:"action")`, served from an in-memory
 * per-run cache that pipeline-tools.ts updates on every
 * start_pipeline/submit_action_result call BEFORE bounding is applied — no
 * silent truncation, no filesystem spooling required.
 *
 * Stripping is ALL-OR-NOTHING across the batch, never per-invocation: a host
 * driving a `spawn_subagents` batch needs every invocation's prompt or none.
 * A partially-stripped batch would silently corrupt an arbitrary subset of a
 * parallel dispatch with no uniform signal the host could act on.

 *                `payload.action.kind === "spawn_subagents"` and at least
 *                one invocation carries a non-empty prompt (stripping every
 *                prompt reclaims the entire overshoot in the observed 3.5MB
 *                case — prompts dominate the payload). For any other
 *                oversized action kind (no bounding strategy currently
 *                applies to those shapes), the overshoot is recorded in
 *                `__bounded` but NOT silently hidden — the caller can
 *                observe `final_chars > budget_chars` and decide how to
 *                proceed; this never happens today (only spawn_subagents
 *                batches are large enough to threaten the budget — see
 *                MAX_RESPONSE_CHARS's derivation). Every degradation is
 *                recorded in `__bounded.applied` with the exact chars
 *                reclaimed. The full action (prompts included) stays
 *                recoverable via
 *                `get_pipeline_state(run_id, format:"action")`.
