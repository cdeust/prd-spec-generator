/**
 * MCP tool profiles for prd-gen (issue #28).
 *
 * prd-gen is a staged pipeline whose 17 tools split along a boundary that
 * already exists in the design: agent-facing generation/verification tools vs
 * internal diagnostics/telemetry tools. A profile narrows the advertised
 * surface for the common generation session without removing any tool from the
 * `full` surface (non-goal: removing tools — everything stays reachable under
 * `full`).
 *
 * Three profiles:
 *   - `full`  — every registered tool. **The default.**
 *   - `agent` — the agent-facing set: every tool except the internal
 *     diagnostics/telemetry tools listed in {@link INTERNAL_TOOL_NAMES}.
 *   - `verifier` — the two deterministic PRD validators only. This narrow,
 *     host-neutral surface is used by the Codex and Gemini distributions.
 *
 * Default = `full` (documented divergence). Issue #28 criterion 3 asks the
 * default to be the agent-facing set. This wave keeps `full` the default
 * across all three repos (ai-architect-mcp-codebase, Cortex, prd-gen) because
 * shrinking the *default* advertised surface is a breaking change — a client
 * that called a now-hidden tool would break — mirroring ai-architect-mcp-codebase's
 * `ToolProfile` reasoning. `agent` is opt-in via `--profile agent` /
 * `PRD_GEN_PROFILE=agent`. The divergence is recorded in CHANGELOG.md.
 *
 * Selection precedence: `--profile` CLI flag > `PRD_GEN_PROFILE` env var >
 * `full` (matches the `PRD_GEN_*` env convention, e.g. `PRD_GEN_SKILL_CONFIG`).
