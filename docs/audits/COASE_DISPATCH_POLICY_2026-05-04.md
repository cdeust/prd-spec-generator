# Coase Dispatch Policy — 2026-05-04

**Analyst:** Coase (boundary + transaction-cost agent)
**Scope:** Parallel engineer dispatch in the agentic-ai monorepo
**Trigger:** 15 locked worktrees observed; cross-agent contamination causing pre-push gate failures

---

## §1 Option Matrix

| Dimension | A: One agent / worktree (current) | B: One agent / clone | C: Branch + locked main | D: CI-as-builder |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Filesystem cost** | ~600 MB/worktree (node_modules copied) | ~1.2 GB/clone (full object store duplicated) | ~600 MB/worktree | Near-zero local; CI runner storage |
| **Time-to-spawn** | 45–90 s (pnpm install in fresh tree) | 3–8 min (clone + install) | 45–90 s | 0 s local; 3–5 min CI queue |
| **Time-to-merge-PR** | Fast if worktree clean; stalls if locked | Fast; no lock contention | Fast | Fast; bottleneck is CI queue depth |
| **Blast radius (single agent failure)** | Leaves locked worktree; poisons next dispatch | Isolated; failure deletes clone | Branch-only; main remains clean | Branch-only; CI runner is ephemeral |
| **Coordination cost (internal)** | **High** — orchestrator must serialize cleanup; no enforcement today | Low | Medium — orchestrator must lock/unlock main | Low — orchestrator only monitors CI status |
| **Transaction cost (external)** | Low | High — clone time, disk I/O per agent | Low | Medium — CI API calls, queue wait, credential management |
| **Root cause of current failure** | Agents `cd` out of assigned worktree; locked worktrees never removed | N/A | N/A | N/A |

**Evidence base:** 15 worktrees currently locked in `.claude/worktrees/`; zero cleanup hooks installed in `.git/hooks/` (only `.sample` files present); `git status --porcelain` shows untracked `.claude/` in main working tree, confirming root contamination.

---

## §2 Recommended Option: A (repaired) with Option C boundary rule

**Option B** has a transaction cost that does not clear: a full `git clone` per agent on a repo with 600 MB node_modules takes 3–8 minutes and ~1.2 GB disk. With 11 parallel agents, that is 13 GB of disk usage and 5+ minutes of pure spawn overhead. The savings (simpler isolation) do not exceed the cost at this dispatch frequency.

**Option D** relocates the build boundary to CI, which is correct long-term but does not address the immediate contamination problem — agents still write to the shared worktree before pushing.

**Option A is the efficient boundary**, but only with two repairs drawn from Option C:

1. The main working tree (`/Users/cdeust/Developments/prd-spec-generator`) is designated read-only for all engineer agents — equivalent to "locking main."
2. Worktree cleanup is made atomic with dispatch: the orchestrator removes the worktree before confirming success back to the user.

**Coase condition:** the coordination cost of enforcing worktree isolation via policy + a 40-line script is lower than the transaction cost of cloning per agent or the ongoing transaction cost of contamination incidents (failed CI, manual `git worktree remove --force`, debug time).

## §3 Orchestrator Policy

### Before dispatching an engineer

1. Run `git -C /path/to/repo status --porcelain` — must be empty (ignoring `.claude/` via `.gitignore`). If not, ABORT dispatch and report the dirty file list.
2. Run `git -C /path/to/repo worktree list --porcelain` — confirm the target worktree slot does not already exist.
3. Run `scripts/dispatch-engineer.sh <agent-id> <branch-name>` — this creates the worktree, runs `pnpm install`, and returns the worktree path.
4. Pass the exact worktree path to the engineer prompt (see §4). Never omit it.

### After an engineer reports back

1. Verify the branch was pushed: `git -C <worktree-path> log origin/<branch> --oneline -1` must return output.
2. Run `git worktree remove <worktree-path>` (no `--force`). If this fails, the agent left uncommitted or unstaged changes — file a contamination report and do not dispatch the next agent until resolved.
3. Delete the local branch tracking entry if no longer needed.
4. Only then dispatch the next agent.

### Forbidden

- Dispatching two agents into the same worktree path.
- Allowing an agent to report success without verifying branch push.
- Using `--force` on `git worktree remove` silently — this means contamination occurred and must be logged.
- Passing the parent root path as the working directory.

---

## §4 Dispatch Contract (boilerplate for every engineer prompt)

```
WORKTREE CONTRACT — READ BEFORE ACTING

You are engineer agent <AGENT_ID>.
Your working directory is: <WORKTREE_PATH>
Your branch is: <BRANCH_NAME>

RULES:
1. Every file path you read or write MUST start with <WORKTREE_PATH>.
   NEVER reference /Users/cdeust/Developments/prd-spec-generator (the parent root).
2. Before your first commit, run:
     git -C <WORKTREE_PATH> status --porcelain
   If any line references files outside your assigned scope, ABORT and report
   "CONTAMINATION DETECTED: <file list>" to the orchestrator.
3. Do NOT bypass pre-push hooks with PRE_PUSH_SKIP_TESTS=1 or --no-verify
   except for branch deletion pushes (git push origin --delete <branch>).
4. When done, push your branch:
     git -C <WORKTREE_PATH> push -u origin <BRANCH_NAME>
   Then report "DONE: branch pushed, worktree clean" to the orchestrator.
5. Do NOT run git worktree remove yourself. The orchestrator does cleanup.
```

## §5 Automation List

| Item | Type | Owner | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `scripts/dispatch-engineer.sh` | Script | Orchestrator invokes pre-dispatch | **To build** |
| Pre-push hook: verify CWD is inside worktree | Hook (`.git/hooks/pre-push`) | Installed per worktree by dispatch script | **To build** |
| Worktree cleanup verification (post-engineer) | Orchestrator-only policy | Orchestrator | **Policy defined in §3** |
| `.gitignore` entry for `.claude/worktrees/` | Config | Repository | **To add** |
| Contamination report log (`logs/contamination.log`) | Script output | `dispatch-engineer.sh` | **To build** |
| CI step: reject PRs from agents that bypassed pre-push | CI workflow | CI (GitHub Actions) | **Future — not blocking** |

### `scripts/dispatch-engineer.sh` contract

Input: `<agent-id> <branch-name> [base-branch=main]`

Steps (all must succeed or script exits non-zero):

1. Assert `git status --porcelain` is clean (excluding `.claude/`).
2. `git worktree add .claude/worktrees/<agent-id> -b <branch-name> <base-branch>`.
3. `cd .claude/worktrees/<agent-id> && pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`.
4. Install the per-worktree pre-push hook.
5. Print the worktree path to stdout for the orchestrator to capture.

### Per-worktree pre-push hook contract

Runs `git status --porcelain` inside the worktree. If any tracked file path resolves outside the worktree root, prints `ISOLATION VIOLATION: <path>` and exits 1.

## Boundary verdict

The boundary that minimizes cross-agent transaction cost is **Option A with Option C's lock rule**: one agent per worktree, main root locked to orchestrator-only access, cleanup atomically enforced by `dispatch-engineer.sh`. The coordination cost of this policy (one script, two hook checks, three orchestrator assertions) is an order of magnitude lower than the transaction cost of cloning per agent (disk, time, parallelism cap) or the ongoing contamination cost (debug time, forced worktree removal, failed CI runs).

The 15 currently-locked worktrees are direct evidence that the cleanup step has zero enforcement today. The policy in §3 closes that gap.
